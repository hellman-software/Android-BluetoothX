# Android BluetoothX Library - A fork of androidx.bluetooth

This library is a fork, or rather a limited copy with changes, of the AndroidX Bluetooth library 
from Google. The reason this exists is because the original library is stuck in alpha state and it 
isn't ready for production use. The goal with this is to patch the existing library with missing 
features and fixes known bugs. The long term goal is to contribute these changes to the original 
library and add one day deprecate this repository.
